					<h1 class="h3">Research Interests</h1>
					<p>I work in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics and 
					quantum information. I am interested in a diverse range of quantum 
					physics, such as many-body entanglement, many-body localization, 
					measurement-induced phase transitions, topological matter, tensor 
					networks, and classical shadow tomography. All of my work utilizes a 
					mix of theoretical and numerical tools.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h1 class="h4">Many-body entanglement dynamics</h1>
					<p>Whether quantum matter obeys an entanglement area-law or 
					entanglement volume-law can reveal much about its phase, topology, 
					error-correcting capacity, etc. More generally, how entanglement 
					propagates over space and time can tell us about how quantum 
					information spreads in a system. However, the curse of dimensionality 
					means that there is a lot of entanglement data: one for every 
					bipartition of a system.</p>

							entanglement dynamics from disconnected regions that were 
							missing from previous coarse-grained analyses. Furthermore, 
							we've found that the entire entanglement spectrum, i.e. 
							entanglements for all possible bipartitions arranged according 
							to region size, is captured by just two parameters: the cost 
							of creating an entanglement domain wall and the slope of 
							entanglement with sub-system size. This insight provided 
							numerical and analytical tools to study quantum information 
							dynamics in random circuits. What other models of 
							exactly-solvable entanglement dynamics are there and what can 
							we learn from them?</p>

					<h1 class="h4">Dynamical Phase Transitions</h1>
					<p>Disorder can localize particles through interference and scattering. 
					Whether such localization can persist in the presence of interactions 
					and allow a quantum system to evade thermalization is the central 
					question in many-body localization studies. These are a kind of 
					dynamical phase transition which is in part characterized by a transition 
					in the scaling of the many-body entanglement. Another such example is 
					the measurement-induced phase transitions, where one tunes the 
					measurement rate <i>p</i> to drive an entanglement transition.</p>

								<p>In <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.98.115109">past</a> <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.094209">works</a>, we have 
								studied localization in the low-lying states of the 
								massless Schwinger model through a variety of numerical 
								techniques including simulation using matrix product states 
								and exact diagonalization to study eigenvalue statistics. 
								More recently, we revisited the measurement-induced phase 
								transition when viewed as a classical shadow tomography 
								prediction scheme. We found that the optimal scaling of 
								the sample complexity &#120515; is obtained at precisely 
								the critical point separating the area and volume-law phases. 
								There are several unfinished questions I would like to 
								explore here: what is the nature of the critical point? 
								Will other dynamical transitions exhibit tomographic 
								optimality, such as disorder-induced localization 
								transitions? In what other ways can classical shadow 
								tomography be used to study quantum information dynamics, 
								operator spreading, learnability, etc. in a more practical 
								setting?</p>

					<h1 class="h4">Classical Shadow Tomography</h1>

					<p>Classical shadow tomography is an efficient protocol for 
					predicting properties of quantum states. Due to its 
					simplicity, it has direct applicability on existing quantum 
					devices. Traditionally, the literature has focused on two 
					tomography schemes: Pauli measurements, which are useful 
					for predicting low-weight operators, and Clifford measurements, 
					which are useful for predicting low-rank operators. The two 
					schemes correspond to the <i>t=0</i> and <i>t=&#8734;</i> 
					limits of a brick-wall circuit composed of Clifford gates. In <a href="https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-06-01-1026/">previous</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01068">works</a>, we 
					demonstrated an efficient technique for performing classical 
					shadow tomography in the shallow circuit regime inspired 
					by tensor networks. Moreover, we found that these intermediate 
					schemes can be useful for predicting quasi-local operators, 
					as well as estimating fidelity without having to apply global 
					Clifford gates, which can be difficult to implement in 
					current devices.</p>

								<p>We also studied finite-depth circuits composed of dual-unitary 
								gates, rather than Clifford gates, in classical shadow tomography. 
								It is well known that dual-unitary gates are good at scrambling 
								quantum information, and have found use in many exotic areas of 
								physics such as modeling black hole phenomena. In our work, we show 
								that the fast-scrambling nature of dual-unitary gates allows them 
								to more quickly approach the Clifford measurement limit <i>t=&#8734;</i> 
								than brick-wall Clifford circuits.</p>
								<p>We also find that the operator spreading dynamics in 
								such circuits exhibit rich physics, including light-cones 
								and chiral excitations. Since quantum phases can broadly 
								be characterized by states related by some sequence of 
								local (unitary or non-unitary) operations, and such 
								operations can similarly define a classical shadow scheme, 
								I would like to explore what insights into the theory of 
								quantum phases of matter can be gleaned from this practical 
								framework.</p>
