					    <p>I work in the field of theoretical condensed matter physics and 
					    quantum information. I am interested in a diverse range of quantum phenomena, 
					    such as many-body entanglement, many-body localization, measurement-induced 
					    phase transitions, topological matter, tensor networks, and 
					    classical shadow tomography. All of my work utilizes a mix of 
					    theoretical and numerical tools. </p>
    				<ol start="1"><h1 class="h5"><li>Many-body entanglement dynamics</li></h1></ol>
    				<p>Entanglement quantifies how quantum information spreads over space 
    				and time. Whether quantum matter obeys an entanglement area-law or entanglement 
    				volume-law can reveal much about its phase, topology, error-correcting 
    				capacity, etc. However, the curse of dimensionality means that there is 
    				<i>a lot</i> of entanglement data: one for each bipartition of a system.</p>
    				<p>In <a href="#ref">[1,2]</a>, we have studied a class of random quantum circuits which 
    				erase local basis information. We found that these ubiquitous models are amenable 
    				to analytical and numerical treatment because they admit a Markovian description. 
    				This allowed us to discover a correction to contiguous-region entanglement dynamics 
    				from disconnected regions that were missing from previous coarse-grained analyses. 
    				Furthermore, we found that the entire entanglement spectrum, i.e. entanglement 
    				for all possible bipartitions arranged according to region size, is captured by 
    				just two parameters: the cost of creating an entanglement domain wall and the 
    				slope of entanglement with sub-system size. This insight provided numerical 
    				and analytical tools to study quantum information dynamics in random circuits. 
    				What other models of &ldquo;exactly-solvable&rdquo; entanglement dynamics are 
    				there and what can we learn from them? </p>
    				<p>In past works, we developed a notion of an <i>entanglement-features Hamiltonian</i>, 
    				which defines an imaginary-time Schrodinger equation for the entanglement data 
    				itself. However, entanglement dynamics only characterizes one aspect of quantum 
    				complexity&ndash;the other is magic, which characterizes the &ldquo;stabilizerness&rdquo; 
    				of a quantum state. Is there a <i>magic-features Hamiltonian</i>, 
    				and what can it tell us about quantum complexity and chaos? We know that quantum chaos 
    				is inherently magical <a href="#ref">[3]</a>. Moreover, recent works have developed one way to 
    				quantify magic called <i>CSS entropy</i>which was used to study magic dynamics 
    				in a brick-wall random circuit, suggesting that a magic-features Hamiltonian 
    				may not be so inconceivable <a href="#ref">[4]</a>. Furthermore, a magic-features Hamiltonian 
    				could shed light on how a single, non-Clifford gate can drive transitions in 
    				sampling outcomes or shift the entire entanglement spectrum <a href="#ref">[5,6]</a>. The simplicity of 
    				these circuit models implies that they may also have tractable entanglement dynamics, 
    				providing a playground to study magic and entanglement dynamics simultaneously.</p>

    				<p>Classical shadow tomography is an efficient protocol for predicting properties of quantum states. 
    				Due to its simplicity, it has direct applicability on existing quantum devices. Traditionally, the 
    				literature has focused on two tomography schemes: Pauli measurements, which are useful for predicting 
    				low-weight operators, and Clifford measurements, which are useful for predicting low-rank operators. 
    				The two schemes correspond to the <i>t=0</i> and <i>t=&#8734;</i> limits of a brick-wall circuit 
    				composed of Clifford gates. In <a href="#ref">[10,11]</a>, we demonstrated an efficient technique for performing 
    				classical shadow tomography in the shallow circuit regime inspired by tensor networks. We found that 
    				these intermediate schemes can be useful for predicting quasi-local operators, as well as estimating 
    				fidelity without having to apply global Clifford gates, which can be difficult to implement in current devices.</p>

					<p>We also studied finite-depth circuits composed of dual-unitary gates, rather than Clifford gates, 
					in classical shadow tomography. It is well known that dual-unitary gates are good at scrambling 
					quantum information, and have found use in many exotic areas of physics such as modeling black 
					hole phenomena. In our work, we show that the fast-scrambling nature of dual-unitary gates allows 
					them to more quickly approach the Clifford measurement <i>t=&#8734;</i> limit than brick-wall 
					Clifford circuits. </p>
					<p>We also find that the operator spreading dynamics in such circuits exhibit rich physics, 
					including light-cones and chiral excitations. Since quantum phases can broadly be characterized 
					by states related by some sequence of local (unitary or non-unitary) operations, and such 
					operations can similarly define a classical shadow scheme, I would like to explore what insights 
					into the theory of quantum phases of matter can be gleaned from this practical framework. 
					Dual-unitary circuits also provide an exactly solvable &ldquo;minimal model&rdquo; for quantum chaos. 
					What can we learn about optimal shadow tomography for other exactly solvable models such as free 
					fermions (matchgates), free bosons (linear optics), SYK models, etc.?</p>

					<p>More generally, I am interested in how classical shadow tomography can be used to diagnose 
					quantum complexity. One characterization of complexity that arises naturally in classical shadow 
					tomography is the shadow norm, which specifies how hard it is to predict an operator given a 
					particular classical shadow tomography scheme. The shadow norm adds nuance to the traditional 
					notions of quantum complexity, as the &ldquo;complexity&rdquo; is now relative to an operator 
					<i>and</i> a particular kind of dynamics. How does this shadow norm relate to other measures 
					of quantum complexity or quantum information dynamics?</p>
					<p>The dynamics of quantum systems are still being explored, for example, in notions of 
					chaos and scrambling. Previous works have shown that chaos is not simply scrambling e.g. even 
					integrable systems with unstable fixed points can be strong scramblers <a href="#ref">[12,13]</a>. Can the shadow 
					norm distinguish between these two concepts? Little is known about the effectiveness of 
					classical shadow protocols outside of a handful of solvable examples. In classical shadow tomography, 
					the rich interplay between state, hamiltonian, and observable is still largely unknown. The 
					existence of a kind of general &ldquo;glossary&rdquo; in classical shadow tomography, where 
					one inputs a state, a hamiltonian, and an operator, and gets a shadow norm as output, would be 
					useful on a numerical and theoretical level.</p>

					<ol start="3"><h1 class="h5"><li>Dynamical Phase Transitions</li></h1></ol>
					
					<p>Disorder can localize particles through destructive interference and
					scattering. Whether such localization can persist in the presence of
					interactions and allow a quantum system to evade thermalization is the central
					question in many-body localization. These are a kind of dynamical phase
					transition which is in part characterized by a transition in the scaling of the
					many-body entanglement. Another such example is the measurement-induced phase
					transitions, where one tunes the measurement rate <i>p</i> to drive an entanglement
					transition.</p>
					
					<p>In <a href="#ref">[7,8]</a>, we have studied localization in the low-lying states of the
					massless Schwinger model through a variety of numerical techniques including
					simulation using matrix product states and exact diagonalization to study
					eigenvalue statistics. More recently, we revisited the measurement-induced phase
					transition when viewed as a classical shadow tomography prediction scheme. We
					found that the optimal scaling of the sample complexity &#120515; is obtained at
					precisely the critical point separating the area and volume-law phases. There
					are several unfinished questions I would like to explore here: what is the
					nature of the critical point? How does it change when we incorporate symmetries?
					Will other dynamical transitions exhibit tomographic optimality, such as
					disorder-induced localization transitions? </p>
					
					<p class="c12"><span>Recent works in measurement-induced criticality have
					incorporated how symmetry can modify the transition <a href="#ref">[9]</a>. In the case of a
					<i>U(1)</i> symmetry, researchers found that the volume
					law phase splits into a charge-fuzzy and charge-sharp phase, depending on
					whether the measurements effectively collapse charge fluctuations. In the
					charge-sharp phase, an neutral observer can learn the total amount of charge in
					a subregion, whereas in the charge-fuzzy phase they cannot. How does this
					learnability transition manifest in the structure of the measurement channel of
					the corresponding classical shadow tomography scheme? How is the optimality
					parameter &#120515; modified in the presence of symmetries?</p>
